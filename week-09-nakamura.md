Before Nakamura introduced the quote from Lev Manovich, Nakamura was discussing how in media like pornography, women and minority races are subject to a certain gaze and are seen as capital. Which brought up the question of how does the way we interact and how are laws changed in relation to this new capital. The he introduced the quote, "inter-active media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure." I think its meant to be understood as the way interactive media, such as social media or email, is organized shows us how the developer thinks.

For example, pinterests allows you to save pictures into different boards based on your interests. Showing that the developer also had many interests that needed to be organized, and based on those interests your feed shows you more related to them. And if you make a board that isn't an interest of yours, you can make it so that it doesn't influence your feed. So the developer also understood the idea that Pinterest is used to brainstorm and find inspiration in general and not just to fuel your immediate interests.
