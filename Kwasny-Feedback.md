Zamora,

Your flarf poem grabbed my attention so much that I had to read it three times before I wrote this. The narrator, the way they speak to the audience and 
the simplicity of the hyperlink images attached to the poem, works in such a unique way! I feel like the poem is simultaneously trying to sell me a donut, 
"Make your life a little more interesting. Add some color to your donuts..." while also judging me, "On second thought you're a lost cause.
Have some plain donuts". The way this is written does remind me a great deal of the syntax that ChatGPT and other AI writing systems use. Great, creative
work here!
