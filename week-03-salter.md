A Gesamtkunstwerk is the “total artwork” introduced by Richard Wagner, who believes that the total artwork should include the work, design, and the process. Throughout the article, “Entangled,” the author discusses different artists that made their own Gesamtkunstwerks. Kurt Schwitter made his own named Merz, where he moved his collage artwork to the stage, using different forms of matter to interact with different subjects on the stage, as the stage moved as well. Bertolt Brecht used his platform to create theatrical demonstrations that focused more on his writing and interacted with the audience using politics. Moholy-Nagy learned from Bauhaus and created four aims and ideas that are needed to create a Gesamtkunstwerk theater work. 

The brand Arcangel Surfware created by Cory Arcangel, can be seen as a Gesamtkunstwerk. Arcangel created a lifestyle brand of comfortable products geared towards web surfing. With the idea of web surfing in mind with his products, introduces part of the technological aspect of the total artwork. He also uses the brand to showcase his artwork; with people buying the company’s products, wearing and using them, it incorporates the audience into the artwork. So Arcangel Surfware is a Gesamtkunstwerk because it's a multimedia and product company that showcases artwork and includes the audience as a part of the art.
