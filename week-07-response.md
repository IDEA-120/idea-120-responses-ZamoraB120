James Bridle's article/essay was definitely interesting to read. I didn't think it was going to be mostly talking about children on the internet and how they are exposed to so many harmful things. He had brought up the auto generated merchandise on like Amazon and other storefronts, but how did he know those were auto generated? Like they couldv'e been, but there are a lot of weird people in the world who would want those items either ironically, or unitronically unfortunately, and would make it themselves. Having younger siblings, I definitely have seen a lot of the videos that Bridle mentions. But as he got into the weird autogenerated videos, once again I was pondering the question are the autogenerated? I'm sure they are in a way because the videos feature a lot of the same characters, items, and music, but is their somebody behind it or is it all algorithm? 

Also while, reading towards the end, I feel like Bridle didn't really give a possible solution to the problem besides getting more people to talk about it. Which I definitely agree, a lot of parents aren't aware of what their kids are watching because they just give them the device and let them be. But what can be done to stop kids from being exposed to these videos? I feel like the Youtube algorithm isn't smart enough to really detect if it's for children or not because it looks like it's kid friendly to an extent. If these harmful videos are being uploaded by bots, I feel like if Youtube could come up with a way to verify that the content was made and uploaded by a human, then it could decrease the amount of autogenerated content. I feel like it's really just up to Youtube/Google to find a way to moderate it because parents can only do so much to protect their kids.
